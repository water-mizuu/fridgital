# Screens (lib/widgets/screens/)

This is where we put each "screen" widget.
A screen is the thing that we see as "layered" in a layout, that you can navigate backwards from.
Each screen can have their own folder structure inside, depending on the logical flow of the screen.

For example:
  - Main Screen:
    - Food Screen
    - Item Info Screen

NOTE: Tabs are the part of a screen that move horizontally via the navigation bar. Screens are layers
  of widgets using the Navigator api.
